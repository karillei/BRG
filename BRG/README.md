Project: Recreating BRG Listings Page
Goal: To showcase the team's listings (and the listing status) and to encourage visitors to call/contact the team for more information. 
Brief Description: The page will need a basic website layout with a heading and menu, there will be rows of 3 to show the listings. The listings will be shown with a picture, listing name, description, and button that will re-direct the user to the respective listing page. Once all the listings have been input, there will be a button that prompts the viewer to call for more listings. Underneath that there will be a banner that encourages the viewer to contact the team and a button that will eventually re-direct the user to the Contact page (for now it will prompt a call). Beneath that banner there will be the team logo that will re-direct to the Homepage. 
Needs: Heading image, title, menu, listing images, listing description, listing buttons, "call for more..." buttons, logo.
